# XDEX

**Xdex** is the crosschain decentralized exchanger of crypto currencies.

> If you know what is [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/),
> Think about **Xdex** as the crosschain version of Automatic Market Makers ([AMM](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers)).

### Competitors vs. Xdex

There are crosschain decentralized exchangers on the market. They are very centralized. Or it's too expensive to participate as a validator.

The centralization, also means,that architecture of the blockchain is not well designed which will lead to hack of the network.

**Xdex** is solving it by relying on the **Ara** blockchain, and making the swapping more controllable by user.

## How Xdex works

**Xdex** *users* can swap token on blockchain A to the token on blockchain B. They send to smartcontract on A the tokens that they want to put. And then claim their tokens on B that they want to get.

The tokens that users want to get are provided by *LP providers*. They are making a crosschain liquidity pair. For the provision of the crosschain liquidity pair,
*LP providers* get earn token for every swap that users made.

In order to interact with the crosschain processes, users and LP providers have to get the proof of the process from the bridge. The bridge of **XDEX** is called *Ara chain*. Its a secure decentralized network of software that is connected to both A and B networks and generates a proof process signature.

*Ara chain* nodes are called *Arachyl*. They charge annual fee of fixed token price from *LP providers*.
*Arachyl* is in hand of governing the **Xdex** platform. Including to give some part of their collected fees to the *developers*.

Its highly intended for *Arachyls* to put some part of earnings in the *developer* rewards.

The nature of **Xdex** is being a open-source, allows any technical skilled people to contribute to the code. And the *developer* rewards are meant to pay for anyone who ever contributes any kind of code improvement.

## Fees

* **User fee** of 1.01% on swapping token amount. Its taken from *users* and distributed to *LP provders*. *The high fee is due to risks that LP providers are taking for themselves. If A blockchain is reverted, then users can get tokens back both on A and B from pocket of LP providers*.
* **LP provider fee** of 200 Ore tokens. Its taken from *LP providers* and distributed to *Arachyls*. *Ore is the Arachain token that is minted by burning CWS*.
* ***Developer* rewards** in Ore tokens given to open source code contributers. The amount of reward is depends on total pool of *Developer* reward and the contributed value to the platform.

## Ore token
**Ore** token is the fuel of **XDEX**.
They are minted as 1/100 of *CWS* token. You burn 1 *CWS* and get 100 *ORE*.

Every Liquidity provider is creating *Ore* token during the liquidity creation.
That *Ore* is automatically send to *Ara* pool.

The *Ara* pool then distributed for *Arachyl* nodes.

### What is the usecase of Ore?
**Ore** is used to use **Xdex** without any swapping fee.
That's it, if you use 100 Ore, then you can do a swapping of tokens without any transaction fee.
