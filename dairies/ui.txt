Ui should be as in ./ui.png. Get that as an inspiration.
When designing the UI, just think about users who will use it not that often.
Yet, they are liking cute things.

As you may see in the background an animated circle rotation.
Let's make the popups as like that. For example the transaction pending.
Or the block confirmation, shows how the blocks are mined in the network.
Plus who mined it. Or about some transactions occuring on the blockchains.

When the error is happening, maybe the circle is turning into vertical with showing the error message.
