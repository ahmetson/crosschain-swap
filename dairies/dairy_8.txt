I found an issue in the porting of Uniswap V2 to Crosschain Dex.
Uniswap heavily relies on the Router that will calculate Input or Output.
Then will transfer tokens to the Core contract.

We fixed by copying the 

https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol#L53

body of function into the Pair.

So, if user wants to get a token from another blockchain, then in the pair the amount in will be calculated 
by copied function body from UniswapV2Library.

On the Website, we need to create a function that will calculate the Amount IN using the JS.
