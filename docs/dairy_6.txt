I did the first version of the smartcontract. Its not yet finished code though. I just added the 
methods with the copied code from Uniswap. Need to adapt to XDEX.

Before adaption, we need to do a change in the architecture that was caused by the addition of the liquidity removing and addition.

The change was caused by the multiple arachyls who passes the signatures to the smartcontract.
This will cause the stack overflow error. In order to fix it, we allowed call of the functions by 
one arachyl.
