This document should highlight the business logic of the application.
As during the development of the project I was stuck with business part.

It is important to think about business logic, since it will atract the investors and users.
If the project is fine from technical perspective, but from business perspective its limited comparing to the 
sinle chain dexes, then it will not atract users due to hard user flow.

To think of business flow, or usability (here in the document user experience and business flow are synonims, since 
it will be profitable if it's easy for users to use),
we must highlight the following properties of the app.

1. User has to interact with minimal transactions on minimal blockchains.
2. Transactions should be fast.
3. Transactions should be cheap.
4. Users should be able to use LP tokens in any chain.
5. Users should be able to transfer LP from one chain to another chain.
6. Investors should be able to lower the Impermanent Loss.
7. Investors should profit from invested tokens, so they will not go away.
