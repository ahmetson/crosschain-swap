Oh man, it was a harder task than I thought. Working at Seascape jumping from one project to another project
in the Seascape ecosystem really exausting.

After that work taking few hours free before going to bed to make XDEX is tireful.

Yet, I also try to make a really super project that peopl would like to have,
even without me. Just like "Satoshi Nakamoo" did.

So, I am thinking to get back to Ara blockchain idea.
As Chainlink is still not ready, yet I almost finished the smartcontrats.

Let's first finish the smartcontracts, then make the Ara blockchain. After that we will think about the 
ARA medium token.
