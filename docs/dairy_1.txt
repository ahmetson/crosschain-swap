Date: 15:00, 15th January, 2022 (GMT+3), Istanbyl Ataturk International Airport.

I am at the airport on my way to Georgia. Arrived in the morning at 6 am, I had to wait as a transfer passanger
till 9:25 PM.

The sad thing about internet is, this Airport allows only one hour free use of wifi, after that, you need to buy a traffic.
However my credit cards are not supported. So, I can not upload my code changes today.

What I've done so far is creation of Pair Creation by user, then an MVP that acts like a bridge to transfer tokens.
Now, only thing to do is:

1. Redeploy the smartcontracts on Rinkeby, Binance Smart Chain testnets.
2. Update the address in smartcontracts/scripts/addresses.js
3. Update the .env variable of smartcontract addresses on ara-mvp.
4. Change the smartcontract address on Eventeum. Restart eventeum to get the changes.
5. Run the Ara MVP
6. Execute the Pair Initiation by the user.
7. Test all the process.

The next thing we need to do is the followings:

1. Write Liquidity Addition process.
2. Write Liquidity Removing process.
3. Write Swap process.

On parallel to implementation of the processes, we also need to use Kovan network as 
an Ara blockchain's native token installment place.

There, we will have ORE token, and Node verifier.
Whenever we will do a process (creation, addition, removal or swap), the Ara blockchain should update the balance of the 
token transferrers.

Another thing that we need to implement is to divide the role fee collectors. Right now, the relayer and verifiers are getting the same 
reward.
