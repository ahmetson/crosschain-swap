Recently found what I was looking for. Chainlink is making a cross-chain interoperability protocol.
And tools that allows blockchain interaction through oracles.

In this case, we don't have to create our own blockchain.

Now, we need to structurize the smartcontracts in a way, so that they will interact via oracles.
